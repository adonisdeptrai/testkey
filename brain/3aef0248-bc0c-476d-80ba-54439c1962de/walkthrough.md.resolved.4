# Docker Integration, Shop Sync & Performance Walkthrough

I have successfully integrated Docker, synchronized the Shop design, optimized desktop performance, and redesigned the layout.

## 1. Layout Redesign
- **Desktop (New)**: Two-column layout with Title/CTA on the Left and Terminal Mockup on the Right.
- **Mobile**: Preserved stacked layout for readability.
- **Hero Terminal**: Made flexible to fit the new column structure.

## 2. Performance Optimizations (Desktop)
- **Component Isolation**: Extracted `AnimatedBackground` and `HeroTerminal` to isolate re-renders.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Added `will-change: transform` to heavy animations.
- **Memoization**: Used `React.memo` to prevent cascading updates.
- **Cleanup**: Removed dead CSS links.

## 3. Shop Design Overhaul
- **Dark Theme**: Unified [Shop.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/Shop.tsx) with [Landing.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/Landing.tsx) (Deep Slate `#020617`).
- **Liquid Glass**: Applied consistent glassmorphism and animations.
- **Consistency**: Unified typography and "Cream Cyan" brand colors.

## 4. Docker Integration
- **Containerized**: Production-ready Nginx setup.
- **Commands**:
    - Start: `docker compose up -d`
    - Stop: `docker compose down`

## Access
- **Local**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Mobile/Network**: **[http://192.168.1.165:8080](http://192.168.1.165:8080)**
