# Docker Integration Walkthrough

I have successfully successfully integrated Docker into your Vite + React application.

## Changes Created

### 1. Dockerfile
A multi-stage build process:
- **Build Stage**: Uses `node:22-alpine` to install dependencies and build the application.
- **Production Stage**: Uses `nginx:alpine` to serve the static files from the build stage.

### 2. Nginx Configuration ([nginx.conf](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/nginx.conf))
- Configured to serve the built static files.
- Includes a fallback to [index.html](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/index.html) for client-side routing (SPA support).
- Enabled Gzip compression for better performance.

### 3. Docker Compose ([docker-compose.yml](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/docker-compose.yml))
- Defines a service named `app`.
- Maps port `8080` on your host machine to port `80` in the container.
- Sets `NODE_ENV=production`.

### 4. .dockerignore
- Excludes unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `.git`, and local log files from the build context to keep the image small and the build fast.

## How to Run

You can now build and run your application using Docker Compose:

1.  **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```

2.  **Start the container:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

4.  **Stop the container:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
