# Docker Integration, Shop Sync & Performance Walkthrough

I have successfully integrated Docker, synchronized the Shop design, and optimized desktop performance.

## 1. Performance Optimizations (Desktop)
- **Component Isolation**: Extracted `AnimatedBackground` and `HeroTerminal`. This prevents the entire page from re-rendering during every simulation tick (1.2s).
- **GPU Acceleration**: Added `will-change: transform` to heavy animations to force GPU layering.
- **Memoization**: Used `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of static components.
- **Cleanup**: Removed dead CSS links to improve load times.

## 2. Shop Design Overhaul
- **Dark Theme**: Unified [Shop.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/Shop.tsx) with [Landing.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/landing-page---v3/Landing.tsx) (Deep Slate `#020617`).
- **Liquid Glass**: Applied consistent glassmorphism and animations.
- **Consistency**: Unified typography and "Cream Cyan" brand colors.

## 3. Docker Integration
- **Containerized**: Production-ready Nginx setup.
- **Commands**:
    - Start: `docker compose up -d`
    - Stop: `docker compose down`

## Access
- **Local**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Mobile/Network**: **[http://192.168.1.165:8080](http://192.168.1.165:8080)**
