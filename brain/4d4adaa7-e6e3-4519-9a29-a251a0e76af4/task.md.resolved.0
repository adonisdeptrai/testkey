# Task: Fix TPBank API TLS Connection in Docker

## Problem
- [x] TPBank API works from local environment (Node.js direct)
- [ ] TPBank API fails from Docker container with TLS error
- Error: "Client socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established"

## Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Check Node.js version differences (local vs Docker)
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS certificates in Alpine container
- [ ] Check network configuration
- [ ] Review axios SSL configuration

## Implementation
- [ ] Add SSL/TLS workaround for Docker environment
- [ ] Update tpbank.js with proper SSL handling
- [ ] Test from Docker container
- [ ] Verify all TPBank endpoints work

## Verification
- [ ] Test connection from Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Verify transaction history retrieval
- [ ] Check auto-login retry mechanism
