# Task: Fix TPBank API TLS Connection in Docker

## Problem
- [x] TPBank API works from local environment (Node.js direct)
- [ ] TPBank API fails from Docker container with TLS error
- Error: "Client socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established"

## Root Cause Analysis
- [x] Check Node.js version differences (local vs Docker)
- [x] Verify SSL/TLS certificates in Alpine container - **Missing ca-certificates**
- [x] Check network configuration
- [x] Review axios SSL configuration

## Implementation
- [x] Add SSL/TLS workaround for Docker environment
- [x] Update tpbank.js with proper SSL handling - **Added httpsAgent**
- [x] Test from Docker container
- [x] Verify all TPBank endpoints work

## Verification
- [x] Test connection from Admin Dashboard
- [x] Verify transaction history retrieval
- [x] Check auto-login retry mechanism
- [x] Confirm no TLS errors in Docker logs
