# Add/Edit Product UI Redesign Plan

The goal is to elevate the "Add/Edit Product" modal in [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx) to a premium "Liquid Glass" experience, matching the high standard of the Landing Page.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> This redesign replaces the standard form with a more immersive, polished interface.

## Proposed Changes

### [MODIFY] [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx)

#### 1. Enhanced Modal Container
- **Backdrop**: Deepen the blur and add a subtle noise texture or gradient overlay.
- **Container**: Use a double-border effect (glass) and a more profound shadow.

#### 2. Layout Overhaul
- **Two-Column Layout (Refined)**:
    - **Left (Form)**: Clean, spacious fields. Group related fields (Basic Info, Pricing, Media) into "Glass Cards" within the form.
    - **Right (Preview)**: Make the "Live Preview" sticky and more prominent.

#### 3. Component Styling
- **Inputs**: Remove standard borders; use bottom-border only or "filled" glass style that glows on focus.
- **Image Upload**: Create a drag-and-drop style zone with an instant preview background.
- **"Features" Input**: Replace the textarea with a "Tag Input" style (Type + Enter to add feature chips).

#### 4. Micro-Interactions
- Add `framer-motion` animations for input focus (scale up slightly).
- Add specific validation animations (shake on error).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Visual inspection via `docker-compose up`.
- Verify responsive behavior (mobile stack vs desktop split).
