# Docker Management Walkthrough

I have added a PowerShell script and updated the configuration to streamline building and pushing Docker images for your application.

## Changes

### 1. [docker-manage.ps1](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/docker-manage.ps1)
A new PowerShell script in the root directory that handles building and pushing images for both the `app` (frontend) and `server` (backend).

**Usage:**
- **Build images locally:**
  ```powershell
  .\docker-manage.ps1 -Action Build
  ```
- **Push images to a registry:**
  ```powershell
  .\docker-manage.ps1 -Action Push -Registry "your_dockerhub_username" -Version "1.0.0"
  ```
  *Note: You must be logged in to Docker (`docker login`) before pushing.*

### 2. [server/.dockerignore](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/.dockerignore)
Added a [.dockerignore](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/.dockerignore) file to the server directory to exclude `node_modules` and other unnecessary files from the build context, speeding up builds and reducing image size.

## Verification Results

### Build Verification
I executed the build script locally, and it successfully initiated the Docker build process for the server component.

```
Building image: r4b-server:latest from ./server...
Running: docker build -t r4b-server:latest .
...
#9 [4/6] RUN npm install
```

The script correctly orchestrates the Docker commands.

> [!NOTE]
> **Pushing to Docker Hub**: To push the images, you must provide your Docker Hub username. Run the script as follows:
> `.\docker-manage.ps1 -Action Push -Registry "your_username"`

### Local Development (Docker Compose)
I have successfully verified that the application runs locally using Docker Compose.

**To start the application:**
```powershell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Access Points:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Mongo Express**: http://localhost:8081

### UI Theme Synchronization
I have synchronized the **Admin Dashboard** with the main website's "Liquid Glass" dark theme.
- **Dashboard**: Switched to `#020617` background with glass-morphism sidebar.
- **Admin Components**: Updated to support dark mode (tables, inputs, cards).
- **Consistent Experience**: Users now experience a seamless transition from the Landing Page to the Dashboard.
