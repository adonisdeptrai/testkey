# Product API & Database Integration Walkthrough

I have successfully migrated the product management system from static files to a robust MongoDB backend.

## 1. Backend Implementation

### Product Model
Created a Mongoose schema ([server/models/Product.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/models/Product.js)) to define the product structure, including:
- `title`, `price`, `description`, `image`
- `features` (replacing the old `tags` system)
- `stock` and inventory management fields
- `type` (Script, Tool, Course, Key)

### API Routes
Implemented full CRUD operations in [server/routes/products.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/routes/products.js):
- `GET /api/products`: Fetch all products
- `POST /api/products`: Create new product (supports image upload)
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update existing product
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Remove product

## 2. Frontend Integration

### Admin Dashboard
- Updated [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx) to fetch products from the API on load.
- Replaced local state management with API calls for Saving and Deleting products.
- Fixed HTML nesting issues that were causing build failures.

### Public Shop
- Updated [Shop.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/Shop.tsx) to fetch products dynamically from the backend.
- Refactored [ProductCard](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/Shop.tsx#46-151) and filters to use the new `features` property instead of `tags`, ensuring consistency with the backend model.

## 3. Database "Auto-Fix" (Seeding)

To ensure the website isn't empty, I created and ran a **Seed Script**.
- **Script**: [server/seed.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/seed.js)
- **Action**: Populated the MongoDB database with the initial premium products (GenLogin Auto-Farmer, GPM Manager, etc.).
- **Result**: The website now displays these products directly from the database.

## Verification

### Build Status
The Docker build is **SUCCESSFUL**.
```
Image app-server Built
Image app-app Built
Container app-server-1 Started
Container app-app-1 Started
```

### API Check
- `GET /api/products` is active and serving data.
- Database connection is established.

## Next Steps
- You can now log in to the admin dashboard and add/edit products freely.
- Changes will persist even if you restart the containers.
