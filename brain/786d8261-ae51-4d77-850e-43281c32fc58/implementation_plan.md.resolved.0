# Dockerization and Deployment Setup

This plan addresses the user's request to "read file and push code to docker" by optimizing the Docker artifacts and providing a script to build and push images.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will add a `docker-manage.ps1` script to help you build and push images. You will need to be logged in to Docker Hub (`docker login`) for the push commands to work.

## Proposed Changes

### Root Directory
#### [NEW] [docker-manage.ps1](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/docker-manage.ps1)
- A PowerShell script to:
    - Build Docker images for `app` and `server`.
    - Tag images with a specified version or `latest`.
    - Push images to a registry (configurable).

### Server Directory
#### [NEW] [server/.dockerignore](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/.dockerignore)
- Add [.dockerignore](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/.dockerignore) for the server to exclude `node_modules` and logs, improving build speed and context size.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- I will run the `docker-manage.ps1` script with a "dry run" or "build only" flag to verify it constructs the commands correctly and builds the images locally.
- Since I cannot authenticate to your Docker registry, I will verify the *build* step succeeds.

### Manual Verification
- User can run `.\docker-manage.ps1 -Action Build` to build locally.
- User can run `.\docker-manage.ps1 -Action Push -Registry "your-username"` to push.
