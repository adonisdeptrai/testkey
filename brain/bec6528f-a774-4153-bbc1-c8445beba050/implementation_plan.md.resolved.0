# MMO Liquid Glass Frontend Implementation Plan

Goal: Create a modern, visually stunning Frontend for an MMO App featuring a "Liquid Glass" (Glassmorphism) theme and demo products.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
- Initialize Vite + React project at `C:\Users\Adonis\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\mmo-liquid-glass`
- **Framework**: React (via Vite) for component modularity.
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (CSS Modules or global CSS) to implement custom Glassmorphism without framework constraints.

### Design System: "Liquid Glass"
- **Background**: Dynamic, moving multi-color gradients (Mesh Gradients) to provide the "liquid" feel behind the glass.
- **Glass Cards**:
    - `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
    - `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`
    - `border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`
    - `box-shadow`: Soft glowing shadows.
- **Typography**: 'Inter' or 'Outfit' from Google Fonts for a gaming/modern aesthetic.

### Content Structure (Demo Product)
1.  **Navigation Bar**: Glass strip with logo and user status.
2.  **Hero Section**: Featured "New Expansion" or "Event" with 3D-like text or floating elements.
3.  **Marketplace Grid**:
    - Demo items: "Void Walker Armor", "Crystal Staff", "Ancient Potion".
    - Each item in a glass card with hover interactions (glow/lift).

## Verification Plan

### Automated
- `npm run build` to verify production build.

### Manual
- Run `npm run dev`.
- Visual inspection of Glassmorphism rendering (blur, transparency) and responsiveness.
