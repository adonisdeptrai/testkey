# Liquid Glass MMO Frontend - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the **Liquid Glass** frontend for your MMO application. It uses a modern, no-build stack (HTML/CSS/JS) so you can run it immediately.

## Features

- **Liquid Glass Theme**: Deep, cosmic dark mode with moving mesh gradients and frosted glass panels.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Background blobs float and morph; cards include 3D tilt effects on hover.
- **Responsive Layout**: Includes a glass sidebar, header, hero section, and a dynamic marketplace grid.
- **Demo Content**: Features "Legendary" gear with rarity tagging and currency formatting.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project folder:
    `C:\Users\Adonis\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\mmo-liquid-glass`
2.  Double-click **`index.html`** to open it in your default browser.

That's it! No installation required.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] **Visuals**: Confirmed "Liquid Glass" blur effects and gradient text.
- [x] **Interactivity**: Hover over product cards to see the 3D tilt and "lift" effect.
- [x] **Responsiveness**: Try resizing the window; the layout adapts.
