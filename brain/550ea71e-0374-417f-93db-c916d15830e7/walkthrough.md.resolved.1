# Walkthrough - Sidebar Product Filtering Fix

I have fixed the issue where "Tools", "Courses", and "License Keys" tabs were empty in the Admin Dashboard.

## Changes

### [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx)
1.  **Added Missing Tabs**: Added conditional rendering for `tools` and `courses`.
2.  **Fixed "License Keys"**:
    - Identified that [KeyManagementView](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#219-265) was not receiving the `products` list.
    - Updated [KeyManagementView](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#219-265) to accept and pass the `products` prop to the internal [AdminProducts](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#167-218) component.
    - Updated filtering to strictly use `ProductType` enum.

```diff
// KeyManagementView now accepts products
- const KeyManagementView = ({ onEdit, onAdd, onSendKey, pendingKeys }: any) => (
+ const KeyManagementView = ({ onEdit, onAdd, onSendKey, pendingKeys, products }: any) => (
  // ...
- <AdminProducts onEdit={onEdit} onAdd={onAdd} filterType={ProductType.KEY} />
+ <AdminProducts onEdit={onEdit} onAdd={onAdd} filterType={ProductType.KEY} products={products} />
```

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
- **Database Data**: I ran a debug script and confirmed that products with types `MMO Tool`, `Course`, and `License Key` exist in the database.
- **Build**: Successfully built and deployed with Docker.

### Manual Verification Steps
1.  **Refresh App**: Refresh the Admin Dashboard.
2.  **Check License Keys**: Click "License Keys" -> It should now display the "GPM Login License" product.
3.  **Check Others**: "Tools" and "Courses" should also display their respective products.
