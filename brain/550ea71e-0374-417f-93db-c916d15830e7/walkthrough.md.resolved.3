# Walkthrough - UI Stability and Customer Data

I have addressed the reported issues regarding UI crashes and placeholder data.

## 1. UI Crash Fix
Fixed the black screen crash that occurred during rapid sidebar navigation.

### Changes
- **Prop Safety**: Added defensive coding to [AdminProducts](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#167-219), [AdminOrders](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#271-316), and [KeyManagementView](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#220-270) to handle `undefined` or `null` data props gracefully.
- **Default Values**: Ensuring all list components default to empty arrays `[]` while data is loading.

## 2. Customer Section
Refactored the "Customers" tab to display real user data.

### Changes
- **Backend**: New `/api/users` endpoint to fetch registered users.
- **Frontend**: Connected [AdminDashboard](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#1312-1553) to the new API and populated the user list.

## 3. Sidebar Filtering
Restored functionality for "Tools", "Courses", and "License Keys" tabs.

## Verification
- **Stress Test**: Rapidly switching between tabs such as "Overview" -> "Products" -> "Tools" no longer causes a crash.
- **Data Check**: The "Customers" tab now lists real users from the database.
