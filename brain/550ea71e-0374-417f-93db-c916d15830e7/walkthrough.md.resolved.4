# Walkthrough - User Menu Navigation & Access Control

I have addressed the navigation issues in the User Menu and implemented access control for the Dashboard link.

## 4. User Menu Navigation
Fixed "dead end" links and incorrect redirects.

### Changes
- **Route Authorization**: Updated [App.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/App.tsx) to allow regular users to access `/dashboard` (User Dashboard), removing the forced redirect to `/shop`.
- **Menu Links**:
    - **Admin Dashboard**: Only visible to users with `admin` role. Redirects to `/admin`.
    - **My Dashboard**: Added explicit link to User Dashboard.
    - **Profile / Settings / Subscription / Help**: All now correctly navigate to the User Dashboard instead of doing nothing or redirecting to Shop.

## Verification
- **Admin**: Sees "Admin Dashboard" in menu. Clicking it goes to Admin Dashboard.
- **User**: Does NOT see "Admin Dashboard". Clicking "Profile" or "My Dashboard" successfully loads the User Dashboard.
