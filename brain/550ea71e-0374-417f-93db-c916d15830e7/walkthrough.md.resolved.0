# Walkthrough - Sidebar Product Filtering Fix

I have fixed the issue where "Tools", "Courses", and "License Keys" tabs were empty in the Admin Dashboard.

## Changes

### [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx)

I added the missing conditional rendering logic for the new tabs and verified the filtering uses strict Enums.

```diff
+ {activeTab === 'tools' && (
+     <AdminProducts
+         onEdit={setEditingProduct}
+         onAdd={() => setIsAddingProduct(true)}
+         onDelete={handleDeleteProduct}
+         products={products}
+         filterType={ProductType.TOOL}
+     />
+ )}
+
+ {activeTab === 'courses' && (
+     <AdminProducts
+ ...
+         filterType={ProductType.COURSE}
+     />
+ )}
```

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- `npm run build` was attempted but failed due to system Execution Policy.
- **Manual Verification Required**: Please run the app and verify the tabs as described below.

### Manual Verification Steps
1.  **Launch App**: Start the application (`npm run dev` or your preferred method).
2.  **Login as Admin**: Access the Admin Dashboard.
3.  **Check Tabs**:
    - Click **Tools**: Should now show products defined as "MMO Tool".
    - Click **Courses**: Should now show products defined as "Course".
    - Click **License Keys**: Should show products defined as "License Key".
