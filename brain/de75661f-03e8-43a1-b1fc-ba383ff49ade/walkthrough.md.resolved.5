# Walkthrough - Remove Toast Border

I have removed the outer rectangular border from the toast notification as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Style Update
- **File**: [src/components/common/Toast.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/components/common/Toast.tsx)
- **Change**: Removed the `border` class from the main container and the `border-[color]` classes from the variant styles.
- **Effect**: The toast now appears as a clean, floating pill with a shadow and semi-transparent background, but without the solid border line.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Triggered a toast in the shop. Verified that the notification is now borderless and cleaner.
