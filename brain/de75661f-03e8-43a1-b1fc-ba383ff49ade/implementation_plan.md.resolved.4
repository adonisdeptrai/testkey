# Implementation Plan - Complete Admin Dashboard Functionality

## Goal Description
Finalize the Admin Dashboard features to ensure it is fully functional as requested.
Key areas:
1.  **Product Management**: Ensure Add, Edit, and Delete work seamlessly with the backend.
2.  **Order Management**: Implement "Verify Payment" logic to update order status.
3.  **QR & Settings**: Ensure Admin Settings (Bank Info) are saved and correctly used by the Checkout page for QR generation.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will assume the `uploads/` directory logic in [products.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/routes/products.js) is sufficient for image handling for now (using local storage), unless cloud storage is requested later.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend
#### [MODIFY] [server/routes/orders.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/routes/orders.js)
-   Implement `PUT /:id/verify` (or similar) to allow admins to mark orders as 'Completed'.
-   Ensure `GET /` returns all orders for admins (it currently might only return user's own orders if I copied it from a user-facing route? I need to check).

#### [MODIFY] [server/routes/products.js](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/server/routes/products.js)
-   Review current implementation (it seemed mostly done in previous steps) to ensure `PUT` and `DELETE` are robust.

### Frontend
#### [MODIFY] [src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx)
-   Connect [handleDeleteProduct](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#1278-1292) to the UI (it logic exists but need to verify `Button` trigger).
-   Implement `onVerify` in [AdminOrders](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#261-302) to call the new backend API.
-   Ensure [AdminSettings](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx#360-558) properly pre-fills data from the backend.

### Integration
-   Verify that [Checkout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/Checkout.tsx) uses the bank info from `GET /api/settings`.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
-   None planned (manual verification via Browser Subagent).

### Manual Verification
-   **Add Product**: Create a new product via Dashboard. Check Shop to see it.
-   **Edit Product**: Change price/title. Check Shop.
-   **Delete Product**: Delete a product. Check Shop.
-   **Order Flow**:
    1.  User buys item (creating 'Processing' order).
    2.  Admin sees order in Dashboard.
    3.  Admin clicks 'Verify'. Status changes to 'Completed'.
    4.  User sees 'Completed' in their history (if User Profile exists, otherwise just Admin side).
-   **Settings**: Change Bank Info in Admin. Go to Checkout. QR code content should reflect new bank info.
