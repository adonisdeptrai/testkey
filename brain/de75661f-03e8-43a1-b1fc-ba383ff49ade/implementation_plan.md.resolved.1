# Implementation Plan - Synchronize UI Theme (Liquid Glass)

## Goal Description
The current [OrderSuccess.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx) implements a light theme which clashes with the global "Liquid Glass" dark theme (`#020617` background, glass panels, cyan accents) used in [Checkout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/Checkout.tsx) and other pages.
The goal is to adapt the **layout and structure** of the APPROVED [OrderSuccess](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx#11-102) design (centered card, checkmark, order details, specific buttons) to the **Liquid Glass Theme**.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I am proceeding with the assumption that "đồng bộ giao diện" means reconciling the clash between the new light page and the existing dark app. I will keep the *layout* of the mockup but use the *colors/effects* of the app.
> If the user wanted the WHOLE APP to be light, this would be a much larger task. Given the history of "Liquid Glass" requests, the Dark adaptation is the safest and most consistent path.

## Proposed Changes

### Pages
#### [MODIFY] [OrderSuccess.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx)
- **Background**: Change from `#f8fafc` (Light Slate) to `#020617` (Dark Blue) with `AnimatedBackground`.
- **Card Container**: Change from White to `bg-[#0b1121]/80 backdrop-blur-2xl` (Glass Panel).
- **Typography**: Change from Slate-900 (Black) to White/Slate-200.
- **Icons**: Ensure the Green Checkmark is adapted or kept if it fits; implied "Cream Cyan" might be better (`text-brand-cyan`).
- **Buttons**:
    - Primary: `bg-brand-cyan text-black` (Standard Brand Button).
    - Secondary: `bg-white/5 text-white border-white/10` (Glass Secondary).
    - Floating Action: `bg-brand-cyan` or `bg-white/10`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Render `/order-success` in browser.
- Verify it looks "consistent" with [Checkout](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/Checkout.tsx#15-334) (Dark, Glassy) but retains the "Payment Successful" layout.
