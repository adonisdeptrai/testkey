# Walkthrough - Order Success Page Redesign (Dark Theme)

I have successfully redesigned the [OrderSuccess](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx#12-105) page to match the application's "Liquid Glass" theme while maintaining the layout of the approved mockup.

## Changes Made
- **Theme Synchronization**: Converted the light-themed card design to a dark theme (`#020617` background) to ensure consistency with the rest of the application (Checkout, Shop).
- **Glassmorphism**: Applied specific glass panel effects (`backdrop-blur-2xl`, white borders) to the central card and details section.
- **Typography & Colors**:
    - Updated text to White and Slate-400 for legibility on dark backgrounds.
    - Used the brand's **Cyan** (`text-brand-cyan`) for accents, totals, and primary buttons.
- **Layout Retention**: Kept the exact structure of the approved mockup (Centered Card, Check Icon, Order Details, Buttons).

## Verification
I verified the implementation by running the application in Docker and comparing the new `/order-success` page with the overall app aesthetic.
