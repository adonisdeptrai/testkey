# Walkthrough - Admin Dashboard Completion

I have finalized the features of the Admin Dashboard, enabling full control over the marketplace.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Product Management
-   **Add New**: Can create new products (Tools, Scripts, Courses, Keys) with pricing, images, and categories.
-   **Edit**: Can update existing product details (Price, Title, etc.).
-   **Delete**: Specific delete button added to remove products from the catalog.

### 2. Order Management
-   **View Orders**: Admins can see all user orders.
-   **Verify Payment**: Implemented logic to manually verify "Processing" orders (e.g., Bank Transfers), marking them as "Completed".
-   **Key Delivery**: Admin can fulfill Key orders manually via the UI.

### 3. System Configuration
-   **Settings**: Admin can configure Bank Account details (Name, Number, Bank) which are used dynamically by the automatic QR code generator on the Checkout page.
-   **Persistence**: Settings are saved to the database.

## Verification
-   **Product Flow**: Added "Test Product", Edited Price to $20, Deleted "Test Product". All successful.
-   **Settings**: Updated Bank Name to "ADMIN TEST" and verified persistence.
