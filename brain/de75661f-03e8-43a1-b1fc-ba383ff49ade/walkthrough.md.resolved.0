# Walkthrough - Order Success Page Redesign

I have successfully redesigned the [OrderSuccess](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx#11-102) page to match the provided light-themed mockup.

## Changes Made
- **New Layout**: Switched from a dark, full-screen glassmorphism design to a clean, centered white card layout on a light background.
- **Typography & Icons**: Implemented bold headings, clear label/value pairings for order details, and a distinct "Payment Successful" checkmark using Lucide icons.
- **Components**:
    - **Order Details**: Displaying Order Ref, Date, Payment Method (with bank icon), and Total Paid.
    - **Buttons**:
        - "Access My Library" (Primary, Dark Blue)
        - "Return to Home" (Secondary, White)
    - **Floating Action Button**: Added a chat bubble icon in the bottom right corner.
- **Animations**: Added `framer-motion` entrance animations for the card and icons.

## Verification
I verified the implementation by running the application in Docker and checking the page at `/order-success`.
