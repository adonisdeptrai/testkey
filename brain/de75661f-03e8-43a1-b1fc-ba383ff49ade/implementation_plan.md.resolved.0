# Implementation Plan - Redesign Order Success Page

## Goal Description
Redesign the [OrderSuccess.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx) page to match the provided high-fidelity mockup. The design shifts from a dark, transparent "Liquid Glass" theme to a clean, light/white card design, but will incorporate the brand's "Cream Cyan" touches where appropriate.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> The new design is significantly different (Light Theme) from the previous Dark Theme implementation. This is based on the user's specific request "Confirm giống thế này" referring to the light-themed image.

## Proposed Changes

### Pages
#### [MODIFY] [OrderSuccess.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Adonis/Downloads/App/src/pages/OrderSuccess.tsx)
- Change background to a light theme (Slate-50 or white gradient).
- Implement a centralized white card layout with soft shadows.
- Update typography to use dark text (Slate-900) for headings and gray (Slate-500) for secondary text.
- Reconstruct the "Order Details" section with a light gray background box.
- Update buttons:
    - Primary: Dark/Black button "Access My Library".
    - Secondary: Outline/White button "Return to Home".
- Add a floating chat action button in the bottom right.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
- Render the `/order-success` route in the browser.
- Verify the layout matches the uploaded image.
- Check responsiveness on mobile (resize window).
